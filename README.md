h1. mpc

Toy project to illustrate secure multi-party computation (MPC).

This project provides a very simple example implementation in Go of two-party computation (2PC) using Yao's garbled circuit protocol with oblivious transfer.

h2. Getting started

Simply run `go test` in the [src](./src) directory. [2pc_test.go](./src/2pc_test.go) provides a walked example of a trivial 2PC to demonstrate the protocol.

h2. Garbled circuits and oblivious transfer

TODO: explanation and references to more information.

h2. Making this useful

TODO: roadmap to get from the simplistic example implementation here to something that is actually useful.
